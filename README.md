How many gold medals were won in women's sports vs men's sports? I chose to use a mosaic plot because it clearly shows the relationship between the categorical variables in this case: gender and gold/not gold medal. The mosaic plot shows from this data (years 2000 through 2016), women’s sports had a greater percentage of gold medals compared to non-gold medals. Men’s sports had a slightly greater percentage of non-gold medals compared to gold medals.
